Certainly, here's a detailed version of the steps to flash your Micromax device with a custom ROM and PBRP (Pitch Black Recovery Project) recovery:

### Flashing Micromax Device with Custom ROM and PBRP Recovery

#### Prerequisites:

1. **Download Required Files:**
   - Stock ROM firmware
   - PBRP recovery image (`recovery.img`)
   - Custom ROM ZIP file
   - GApps (if necessary)

2. **Install SP Flash Tool:**
   - Download and install SP Flash Tool on your computer.

3. **Unlock Bootloader (if necessary):**
   - Ensure your device's bootloader is unlocked.

#### Steps:

1. **Flash Stock ROM:**
   - Power off your Micromax device.
   - Launch SP Flash Tool on your computer.
   - Load the scatter file and flash the stock ROM following SP Flash Tool instructions.
   - Once flashed, do not update the stock ROM.

2. **Flash PBRP Recovery:**
   - Boot your device into fastboot mode using the hardware key combination (usually Volume Down + Power).
   - Connect your device to the computer via USB cable.
   - In the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where `recovery.img` is located.
   - Flash PBRP recovery using the command:
     ```
     fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
     ```
   - Do not reboot into the system; instead, boot directly into recovery using the hardware key combination or `fastboot reboot recovery`.

3. **Install Custom ROM and GApps:**
   - In PBRP recovery mode, you can navigate using the hardware buttons or touchscreen (if supported).
   - Wipe data and cache (optional but recommended).
   - Install the custom ROM ZIP file.
   - Install GApps (if your custom ROM doesn't come with them).

4. **Format Data Partition to F2FS:**
   - In PBRP recovery mode, go to "Wipe" > "Format Data" and type 'yes' to format the phone. This will remove all data.
   - Go back to "Wipe" > "Advanced Wipe" > "Data."
   - Click on "Repair or Change File System" and choose "F2FS." Proceed with the change.

5. **Reboot to System:**
   - After formatting to F2FS, go back to the main menu in PBRP recovery.
   - Reboot your device to the system.
   
Now your Micromax device is flashed with the custom ROM, running on F2FS file system, and ready to use. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully, and always ensure you have proper backups before performing any operations that involve data wiping or flashing new software.
